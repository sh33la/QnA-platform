        question: 'What is the easiest and most effective way of realizing God or realizing God? Prove by evidence.',
        answer: 'There are many schools of thought that tell you that you are already God, and it’s just an illusion that makes you think you are separate from God. So, all you need to do is “realize” that you’re actually God. After you realize this, you never have to return to your separate existence again. You’re then one with the universal intelligence.',
